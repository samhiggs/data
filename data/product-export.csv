<p>As always, we give it the full loved-up treatment in the winery. Wild yeast, 65% whole bunches in the ferment and 11 days on skins before heading to barrel in 100% French Oak (29% new) for nine months before being bottled without fining or filtration. The wild yeast adds texture, the whole bunches light and space and no fining and filtration makes sure nothing is stripped out of the final wine.</p>

<p>Dark cherry-red in colour with vibrant fruit aromas of dark plum, macerated summer berry fruits along with higher tones of raspberry and redcurrant. Here are hints of deep exotic spice, Barossa earth, roasting meats, licorice, violets and gentle nutty French Oak nuances.<br /><br />Medium-bodied on the palate with a lovely bright line across the palate and a sense of space to the mouthfeel. Once more the fruit flavours are of dark and black-fruits; dark plum, blackberry, mulberry with some blueberry and raspberry notes adding lift to the wine on the palate. Plenty of spicy notes, meaty nuances, floral lift and earthy tones mesh together on the palate. The finish lingers persistently and is pure and juicy with the fruit coming to the fore, gentle sandy tannins providing support and a bright line of acidity providing the drive. Elegant, delicious drinking from the excellent 2016 vintage.</p>

<p><span style=""color: #333333; font-family: Montserrat, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;"">Addressing the milkshake part first, it’s a turbid affair and the lactose – a sugar found in milk – offers a notable creaminess and sweetness; indeed, if you’ve a low tolerance for sweetness you might feel tested by the time you get to the bottom of the glass, but for anyone else there’s no such trouble. Sweetness plays an important part in the beer, working alongside the pineapple and the hops to add to what's a whopping tropical fruit hit while also helping shave the sides off any bitterness. With the coconut flavour coming in beneath and also boosting the creaminess, there’s a lot going on and you feel the balance could tip as easily as one of those little cocktail umbrellas. But it all remains as in tune as Rupert Holmes in the 1979 classic and gives new meaning to the idea of a desert island beer.</span><span style=""color: #333333; font-family: Montserrat, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;""></span></p>

<p>Made by Ludwig ""Lulu"" Bindernagel. The original vineyard is about 2.5 hectares in Arlay, in the center of the Jura, and Ludwig has since expanded the estate to include vineyards at Poligny and Etoile and the legendary Château-Chalon. Their vineyards are organic and they do not use any insecticides, chemical fertilizers or machinery; they are also in the process of gaining Biodynamic certification.  The soil is very unique, with two marly layers and a calcareous stratus, which is rich in fossilized oysters. The vines are among some very old stocks and are not genetically modified.</p>
<p>75% Chardonnay, 25% Savagnin.  Light medium gold in color. Jura's quintessential ""sherry-esque"" nose is up front, almonds, juicy white peach and blood orange sneak up too.  Super oily, traces of vanilla, glittery with minerals and bits of lemon.  Not particularly acidic but not flabby, long finish.

Another of the Yelland &amp; Papps range that really gets my mouth watering in anticipation when I know it’s on its way to my home. It’s certainly not your normal Rousanne of course but it’s definitely generating interest in wine drinkers. With first pour the colour was cloudy but nothing like the second pour after I gave the bottle a bit of a twist and shake. It looked like home-made ginger beer. That was where the ‘cool’ factor came into effect for me. Take in the aromas and you’ll find it’s citrusy but also a bit spicy. Sensory excitement for my eyes and nose setting up the taste buds for the best part. Those citrusy characters are on the palate too with great texture and some acidic zing, zip and liveliness adding pretty good length to it plus, there’s that subtle spiciness again. You can taste the personality in this wine. Loved it! </p>

<p>Viticulture<br />Gruner Veltliner means literally ‘green grape from the village of Veltlin in the Tirol (Austria)’. Courabyra vineyard sits on a west facing slope on deep weathered granite soils near Tumbarumba, at the foothills of the Snowy Mountains.  This was the first harvest of Gruner Veltliner grapes, dry-grown on a block with East-West row orientation.</p>
<p>Winemaking                                                                                                                 <br />High quality grapes were hand harvested in mid-March at 11.9 Baume and whole bunch pressed oxidatively.  The juice was fermented on full lees at about 18 deg C.  The wine was matured briefly on lees before bottling in June 2017. </p>
<p>Taste <br />This dry style is clean on the nose with aromas of lime-leaf, white pepper, celery salt and a hint of honeysuckle.  Fresh lime and nashi pear and more spicy white pepper energise the mid-palate.  The finish is clean, refreshing and persistent.  The Ledger Gruner Veltliner makes a great aperitif, or matches well with many South-East Asian cuisines.</p>","White Wine",,,,,,,"Gruner Veltliner",19.35,36,,,"GST on Income",3.27273,,,Collector,Negociants,,1,1,6,0,0

The Bowe Lees vineyard lies 390 metres above sea level and was planted between 1998 and 2002. Col fills in the winemaking specs thus: fruit was handpicked and destemmed; maceration times varied, up to (a Lunga Macerazione) 71 days on skins. Post pressing, the wine was racked to barrel for 10 months for malo and maturation. The earlier bottling is designed to catch as much primary charm as possible. And it works. It's a fluid, juicy and complex Nebbiolo that drinks beautifully now. - Bibendum </p>","Red Wine",,,,,,,"Nebbiolo; Adelina",27,49,,,"GST on Income",4.45455,,,Adelina,"BIBENDUM WINE Co.
