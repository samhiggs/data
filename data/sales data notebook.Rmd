##This is raw liquor store POS data

```{r}
liquor_data <- read.csv("G:/My Drive/University/2018/Semester 2/DATA1001 Data Science/project1/data/data/sales_32359.csv")

head(liquor_data)
```

##Summary of raw liquor store data
```{r}
str(liquor_data)
```

##We can safely strip away some variables.
```{r}
liquor_data_rel <- liquor_data[which(liquor_data$Line.Type=="Sale"), names(liquor_data) %in% c("Quantity", "Subtotal", )]
```



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
