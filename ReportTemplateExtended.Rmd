## Initial Data Analysis (IDA)

RStudio has many data sets already loaded in. The example below uses preloaded data direct from RStudio example dataset: mtcars.

Read about the [mtcars data set](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html).

In the rmd file, you will see how you can load your own dataset from either 1) an online source using a URL or 2) a local file on your own computer.

```{r}

# LOAD alcohol and weather data
alc_data = read.csv("data/ProcessedData.csv")

# Quick look at top 5 rows of data
head(alc_data)

## Size of data
# For the mtcars dataset, there are 32 rows (the types of cars) and 11 variables (properties of the cars).
dim(alc_data)

## R's classification of data
class(alc_data)

## R's classification of variables
str(alc_data)
#sapply(mtcars, class)
```

Summary:

- The data came from two different sources. The weather data came in two different data sets from the [Bureau of Meteorology] (http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/) website and the sale data of alcoholic beverages came from a local store in Sydney. We are using data from both resources and combining the into one big dataset. a

## Images

Here is am image. It has not been adjusted in the rmd file, so represents the true size of the original image. This image is sourced directly from an online url. 

To learn more about adding images directly from your own computer, see the comments in this rmd file. 

![](https://petcube.com/blog/content/images/2017/08/kitten-supplies-cover.jpg)

<!-- Begin comment

Use the line below if you are sourcing an image from your own computer. For this line to run correctly, you would need to have an image called 'kitten.jpg' in a folder called 'figure' which is in the same folder as this rmd file.

![](figure/kitten.jpg)

-----------------------------
**Making image adjustments**
With some changes to the rmarkdown in the rmd file, you can also to reduce the image size by, say, 50% and make it left aligned:
<div align="left">
<img src="figure/kitten.jpg" width="50%" height="50%">
</div>
-----------------------------

Give it a try! Find a picture of a kitten online, save it to your computer as described above and see what happens.

## Videos

Below you will find a video embedded into your RMarkdown file. 
Change the YouTube link in the rmd file to get a different video.

<div style="max-width:640"><div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a6KGPBflhiM" width="560" height="315" style="position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>

<br>

## LaTeX

You can even use LaTeX in an RMarkdown document!

For example, how could you work out $\sum_{i=1}^{5} x_{i}^3$?

<br>

## R Code

Here is an R code chunk:

Try the following commands in R.
```{r,eval=F}
1+ exp(3) + sin(0.5)
x=c(1,2,3)
x^2
sum(x)
```

Here is some in-line code `in-line code`. You can put any R code here for display, e.g. `sum(x)`
